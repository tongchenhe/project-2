## Summary
In this project, weâ€™ll use the U.S. Household Income data set from kaggle.com to get income by city, and compare with the number of fast food restaurants in the corresponding city using the dataset from kaggle.com called Explore American Fast Food Restaurants Data. We want to see if there is a correlation between the number of fast food restaurants and average household incomes for each city.

## Data extracted from Kaggle as csv files: 
Income - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations 
Fast Food Restaurants - https://www.kaggle.com/code/agilesifaka/explore-american-fast-food-restaurants-data/data?select=FastFoodRestaurants.csv
